# Commands

There are a lot of goals for the commands.  Here, I'll outline a few of them.

* Commands should provide:
 * the command logic used to process the AST of its arguments
 * the name of the parser used to construct an AST from its arguments
 * the restrictions on this command
 * the help for this command, complete with:
  * description
  * permissions
  * type of command (OOC, IC, etc)
  * categories of command (craft, combat, etc)
  * syntax
  * usage examples
  * package responsible
  * related commands
